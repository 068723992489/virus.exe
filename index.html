    Fair Use Policy
    Our current stance is that our utilization of materials falls under "fair use" because:

    Our providing of materials are only for the purpose of serving the needs of students of an academic program, the IB program.
    We use the materials for nonprofit purposes.
    The nature of all materials is that they are all relevant to the IB academic program and of educational worth.
    All materials are meant specifically for use with the IB academic program, and not others.
    Offering excerpts of these materials to the students is not sufficient for educational purposes and needs, as textbooks/past papers/lit-charts need to be utilized in their entirety.
    We do not believe that we are hurting the current market.

By accessing and using this website, you acknowledge and agree to our fair use policy.
